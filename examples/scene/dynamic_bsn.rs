//! Demonstrates loading scenes from `.bsn` asset files.
//!
//! A `.bsn` file is data, not code: it is parsed at runtime and resolved against the type registry,
//! so it can be edited — and reloaded — without recompiling. This example shows the pieces that
//! makes that useful:
//!
//! 1. **Loading a `.bsn` file as an asset** and spawning it with [`ScenePatchInstance`]
//!    (`assets/scenes/dynamic_bsn_example.bsn`).
//! 2. **One `.bsn` file inheriting another** with `:"path.bsn"`, overriding individual fields —
//!    the styled `#Confirm` button inside that same file.
//! 3. **Inheriting a `.bsn` file from Rust** inside a [`bsn!`] macro, again with `:"path.bsn"`.
//! 4. **`#Name`s**, which become [`Name`] components and are how Rust code finds a particular
//!    entity inside a spawned scene.
//! 5. **Enum patching**, which is match-or-reset: naming a different variant replaces the whole
//!    value rather than merging into it.
//!
//! Note the difference in what the two forms accept: the `bsn!` macro below uses Rust function
//! calls (`px(24)`, `Color::srgb(...)`) and could use constants like `Color::WHITE`, while a `.bsn`
//! file supports neither, and spells the same values out as struct literals
//! (`Color::Srgba(Srgba { red: 0.95, ... })`).
//!
//! ## Hot reload
//!
//! Run the example with the `file_watcher` feature:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo run --example dynamic_bsn --features file_watcher
//! ```
//!
//! then edit `assets/scenes/dynamic_bsn_example.bsn` or `assets/scenes/dynamic_bsn_button.bsn`
//! while it is running — change a color, a size, or the button's label — and save. The changed
//! file is reloaded, every scene that inherits from it is re-resolved, and the spawned entities are
//! rebuilt in place. Editing the *base* button file updates both buttons at once.
//!
//! Requires the `bsn_asset` cargo feature (enabled by default).
