//! Harness shared by the crate's `#[cfg(test)]` suites.
//!
//! The lib tests in `lib.rs`, `spawn.rs`, `dynamic/tests.rs` and `dynamic/attack.rs` all need the
//! same two things: an [`App`] carrying the asset and scene plugins, and a bounded pump that
//! turns "never reached the expected state" into a failure rather than a hang.
//!
//! The integration tests in `tests/` keep their own copies on purpose: sharing this module across
//! the lib/integration boundary would mean exporting it publicly behind a feature, which is not
//! worth it for three functions.
